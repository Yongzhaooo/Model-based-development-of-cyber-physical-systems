# Model-based-development-of-cyber-physical-systems
Course at Chalmers University of Technology

For this course, I learned to build models by Simscape, and the most important part was the drone project. 

In the project, we translated our LQR controller logic into C codes.  dealing with those problems such as Mutex Semaphore and Blocking and Waking Up, and applied the codes to the crazyflie drone and achieved a successful LQR controller.

The performance video is in the 'Drone_performance' directory.

Thanks to my team members, without them, I cannot achieve this project of course.

Since the original codes are managed by TAs, and the key part is Project 5 which is done by the group, I deleted them here in case of plagiarism.

If you are a Chalmers student and you have problems with pro5, you should go to consultant time, which is quite generous in this course. Also Thanks to Ze Zhang's effort, a rarely responsible TA I have ever seen here.

DON'T NOT copy the use the codes directly!


If you plagiarize, you will gain nothing and only face judgment in an academic court.
